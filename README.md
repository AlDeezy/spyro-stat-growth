Mod for Spyro the Dragon 1998, using RedHot's amazing [psx-modding-toolchain](https://github.com/mateusfavarin/psx-modding-toolchain)

Current progressive modifiers, both of which scale with gems collected:
+ Jump Height
+ Maximum Charge Speed

In addition, Charge Jumps and Jump Charges were nerfed to reduce their usefulness in the early game. Both scale with gems as well!

Good luck!
